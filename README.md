# APS-Project-Binomial-Heap
Implementing Binomial Heap with one application and comparing the Heap operations with the AVL Tree
So the main aim of this project was to implement all the operations of a Binomial Heap like insert,delete,merge etc. and then compare the running time of these operations when the same operations is being performed on AVL Trees as well.
This project also invloves creating one application where Binomial Heaps can be used.

## Getting Started
The following instruction will help you how to copy and run the project on your local machine for testing purposes.

### AVL Tree
AVL Tree will contain only unique values.
On successful compiltation, the program will have menu driven functionality in which the user needs to enter which functionality he/she needs to perform.
#### AVL Operations are as follows
1. Insert
  On selecting this operation the user needs to first enter the number of nodes he/she needs to insert into the AVL Tree and then accordingly enter the node's value to be inserted in the AVL Tree.

2.)Display
  It display the AVL Tree in InOrder fashion.

3.)Delete
  It asks for the node value to be deleted and then prints the output message of the operation accordingly

4.)GetMin
  It prints the smallest element present in the AVL Tree.

5.)Extract Min
  It returns the smallest element from the AVL Tree. It removes the smallest element from the tree as well.

6.)Merge
  It invloves merging two AVL Trees. For this operation, the user needs to create a second new AVL Tree(through this operation only) and then this newly created tree will be merged with the already present AVL tree.
